(1, '\'I knew in my heart she was gone\' - families remember loved ones at Omagh inquiry', 'Families remember Omagh loved ones', '<p>The brother of a young GAA star murdered in the Omagh bombing has given emotional evidence to the public inquiry about his family\'s devastating loss.</p><p>Cathal Logue was giving evidence about his sister, Brenda Logue, who was killed in the 1998 explosion.</p><p>The inquiry will look at whether the bombing, which killed 29 people, including the mother of unborn twins, could have been prevented.</p><p>Brenda was 17 and the only daughter of four siblings. She was a talented Gaelic footballer and since her death a junior championship cup has been named in her honour.</p><p>Brenda\'s mother Mary was diagnosed with terminal cancer last year and died in November. She had written a statement before her death, which Cathal read to the inquiry today.</p><p>In it, Mary spoke of the special relationship she had with her only daughter and how much she had missed out on not seeing her grow up.</p><p>Mary had been with Brenda in Omagh on the day of the bombing.</p><p>She said the last thing she remembered was watching Brenda\'s ponytail swinging as she left the shop to see what was going on in the street.</p><p>\"The blast would throw me back into a wall and I would be knocked unconscious, or so I was told,\" her statement said.</p><p>\"When I came around, I knew in my heart she was gone. But I got up and went outside to look for her.</p><p>\"It was like a scene from a disaster movie. I won\'t go into detail, but the things I saw that day are the things that will haunt my dreams, the sounds, the screams.\"</p><p>In her statement, Mary Logue spoke of a principled young woman. She had led a campaign at her secondary school to allow girls to wear trousers. She told school management it was unfair that girls should be cold.</p><p>Brenda was also a talented GAA player and made the Tyrone minor and senior panels.</p><p>\"She had great potential, as I was told by many, and I often wondered how far she would have went,\" Mary\'s statement said.</p><p>\"Tyrone ladies went on to win the All Ireland in 2018. Would she have been part of that set up? Would she have walked the Hogan Stand steps to lift the All-Ireland trophy?\"</p><p>A number of other club and county competitions were named in Brenda\'s honour. One of the trophies was won by a niece of Brenda\'s in later years, and the team brought the cup to Brenda\'s graveside in tribute.</p><p>Mary said the murder of Brenda had affected generations of her family. Her 13 grandchildren grieved for an aunt they had never met.</p><p>\"They see her picture and hear the stories and visit her grave,\" her statement said.</p><p>\"How do you explain to young children at four, five, six and even seven, how their auntie Brenda died? How can a child comprehend that?</p><p>\"And when the older ones come of age and learn the truth and begin to ask questions of why, we relive it all over again.\"</p><p>Mary also questioned whether her cancer would have been caught earlier if her only daughter had still been alive and whether it had been brought on by the stress of her murder</p><p>She spoke about how she had cleared her daughter\'s \"messy\" room. She said she had bagged everything up \"even the rubbish on the floor\" and put it in the attic.</p><p>\"Everything and anything she had ever owned or even touched. It\'s still in the attic. I couldn\'t bear to look at it.\"</p><p>The family say they never released a picture of Brenda and the ones in public circulation had not been issued by them.</p><p>A statement by the mother of 17-year-old Jolene Marlow was also read to the inquiry by a legal representative.</p><p>Bridie Marlow said her daughter, who was the eldest of five children, was academically talented and an excellent sportsperson.</p><p>Shortly before she was murdered in the bombing she had helped her club win their first ever county title.</p><p>She wanted to be a sports psychotherapist and was about to begin a course of study in Belfast.</p><p>\"We always secretly dreaded the thought of Jolene being in Belfast in case the Troubles would flare up,\" her mother said.</p><p>\"Little did we know then that our home town of Omagh, where Jolene had attended school, had a part-time job, was learning to drive, socialised and shopped, would be the actual place where she would be denied all her hopes and dreams of her bright future.\"</p><p>The family of Bryan McCrory was remembered in a statement by his daughter Louise, who described him as a \"gentle giant\" with a \"beautiful open smile that made you feel safe\".</p><p>She told the inquiry how his children had gone to his grave on the morning of their weddings \"to be able to share a part of the day with him\".</p><p>Instead of his presence at the wedding celebrations, they had a picture of their father on the table.</p><p>\"It\'s impossible to explain how important he was to all of us and how much his presence was and is missed in our daily family life,\" she said.</p><p>He loved to take pictures and had gone to Omagh the day of the bombing to leave in films to be developed.</p><p>He was described as a natural with children with whom he had a great affinity.</p><p>The family had missed out on the simple pleasure of \"just being together\".</p><p>\"We have missed out on so many things post 15 August 1998 as a family,\" Louise said.</p><p>\"Our family events are overshadowed by an immeasurable loss and always a constant awareness of a missing husband, father, and friend. Our gentle giant.\"</p><p>She said he was much more than a name on a list or a face in a collage of beautiful faces of those who died in the bombing.</p><p>Over the last two weeks, family members of the 29 victims have been giving an account of their loved ones to the inquiry, setting out the scale of the devastation caused by the bombing and their sense of loss.</p><p>Yesterday, Michael Gallagher, who was driving force in the establishment of the public inquiry, gave evidence about his 21-year-old son Aiden.</p><p>In the course of his evidence, he said the Real IRA bombers had been \"freedom takers\" rather than the freedom fighters they had presented themselves as. </p>', '1_omagh.png', 1, 1, 1, '2025-02-05', '2025-02-05'),
(2, 'USPS Halts All Packages From China, Sending the Ecommerce Industry Into Chaos', 'US Halt On Packages From China', '<p>The United States Postal Services has abruptly stopped accepting all packages from Hong Kong and China until further notice, according to an international service disruption notice posted on the USPS website. The move comes after China imposed retaliatory tariffs on US imports, including coal and liquified natural gas, in response to President Trump\'s executive order to increase tariffs on China.</p><p>Daniel, the owner of a trucking company based in Alberta, Canada, who asked to only use his first name for privacy reasons, tells WIRED that two of his company\'s trucks were turned away at the US border in New York and Montana today because they contained packages originally from China. After speaking with a US Customs and Border Protection agent in Montana, the company was able to get a third truck into Washington state by removing all packages from China, Daniel says.</p><p>He adds that identifying and separating packages from China is an arduous process because the goods that his trucks carry usually include thousands of small parcels like DVDs, toys, and video games, all coming from a variety of sources.</p><p>\"We talked to the Montana CBP cargo supervisor, and they said everything is from the higher-up,? Daniel says. \"A lot of trucks were actually turned away today at the border, we were told by our drivers. And a lot of officers were checking the trucks and questioning [drivers] like, ?Are you sure there are no made-in-China items in there? This is your last chance.? They were actually going through the trucks and randomly checking the packages.?</p><p>Previously, packages like the ones Daniel\'s company often handles could move freely across the border. Trump\'s executive order, though, not only imposes an additional 10 percent tariff on goods from China but also ends a key import tax exemption, one that has enabled the rise of Chinese ecommerce platforms like Temu and Shein.</p><p>Known as de minimis, the rule waives import duties for small packages valued at less than $800 shipped into the US. Originally intended to exempt personal gifts and other items that Americans send home from trips abroad, it has since allowed foreign businesses to more easily sell goods to US consumers without needing to worry about paying import taxes. The number of de minimis packages has soared in recent years as the ecommerce market has become more global, making it difficult, if not impossible, for Customs and Border Protection to keep track of all the parcels flowing into the US.</p><p>According to the CBP, over 1.36 billion de minimis packages entered the US in fiscal year 2024, almost 10 times the number in 2015. That amounts to 3.7 million packages per day on average, many of which are now subject to scrutiny at the border for the first time.</p><p>\"On a daily basis, US Customs will file and process about 100,000 entries,? says Bernie Hart, vice president of customs and trade management business development at Flexport, a US supply chain management company. Now, agents have to process a few million more packages a day, verifying what\'s in them and how much they cost.</p><p>While previous administrations have considered removing the de minimis exemption or introducing reforms, Trump is the first to have actually done so. \"This is the administration\'s version of moving fast and breaking things,? says Ram Ben Tzion, cofounder and CEO of Publican, a digital shipment vetting platform, citing one of the core tenets of startup culture.</p><p>The move could potentially create chaos and confusion across the online shopping industry, as well as make purchases more expensive for consumers, especially because many global manufacturers and internet sellers are located in China. Shoppers are now on the hook not only for the additional 10 percent tariff, but also whatever original tax rate their products were exempted from until Tuesday.</p><p>Cindy Allen, who has worked in international trade for over 30 years and is the CEO of the consulting firm Trade Force Multiplier, gave WIRED an example of how much additional cost the tariff will incur: A woman\'s dress made of synthetic fiber shipped from China through de minimis will now be subject to a regular 16 percent tariff, a 7.5 percent Section 301 duty specifically for goods from China, the new 10 percent tariff required by Trump, additional processing fees and customs brokerage fees, and perhaps increased brokering and handling costs due to the sudden change in rules.</p><p>\"Will the dress that was $5 now cost $5.50 or $15?? says Allen. \"That we don\'t know. It depends on how those retailers react and change their business models.?</p><p>In the immediate term, clearing customs will become a challenge for most ecommerce companies. Their long-term concern, though, is the potential impact on profitability. The appeal of Temu and Shein and similar Chinese ecommerce companies is how affordable their products are. If that changes, the ecommerce landscape and consumer behavior in the US may change significantly as well.</p><p>While the USPS has announced the suspension of accepting any parcels from China and Hong Kong, CBP hasn\'t elaborated on how the agency will enforce Trump\'s new tariffs other than saying in an announcement that it will reject de minimis exemption requests from China starting today. CBP did not immediately reply to WIRED?s request for comment.</p><p>While trucks can be turned away easily at the border of entry, it will be a bigger challenge to stop cargo flights that are loaded with goods, which in recent years have been a preferred shipping method for de minimis packages.</p><p>There are two potential outcomes in the near term. If CBP decides to hold all de minimis packages from China at the border until they have been correctly categorized and the import duties paid, it could cause a massive backlog, leaving customers waiting indefinitely for their orders.</p><p>Alternatively, CBP could choose to keep things moving and charge the tariffs retroactively, according to Hart. There\'s a mechanism called \"liquidation? that allows the US government to take a year or even longer to calculate the final import duties and charge importers retroactively. \"So from a liquidation perspective, you\'re kind of on the hook for a little while,? he says. For now, it\'s unclear how many packages will be making it across the border in the first place.</p>', '2_chinaMail.png', 2, 2, 2, '2025-02-04', '2025-02-04'),
(3, 'Despite Catastrophic Hacks, Ransomware Payments Dropped Dramatically Last Year', 'Ransomware Payments Down Despite Hacks', '<p>For much of the past year, the trail of destruction and mayhem left behind by ransomware hackers was on full display. Digital extortion gangs paralyzed hundreds of US pharmacies and clinics through their attack on Change Healthcare, exploited security vulnerabilities in the customer accounts of cloud provider Snowflake to breach a string of high-profile targets, and extracted a record $75 million from a single victim.</p><p>Yet beneath those headlines, the numbers tell a surprising story: Ransomware payments actually fell overall in 2024?and in the second half of the year dropped more precipitously than in any six-month period on record.</p><p>Cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis today released a portion of its annual crime report focused on tracking the ransomware industry, which found that ransomware victims? extortion payments totaled $814 million in 2024, a drop of 35 percent compared to the record $1.25 billion that hackers extracted from ransomware victims the previous year. Breaking down the payments over the course of 2024 shows an even more positive trend: Hackers collected just $321 million from July through December compared to $492 million the previous half year, the biggest falloff in payments between two six-month periods that Chainalysis has ever seen.</p><p>\"The drastic reversal of the trends we were seeing in the first half of the year to the second was quite surprising,? says Jackie Burns Koven, who leads cyber threat intelligence at Chainalysis. She suggests that dropoff is likely due to law enforcement takedowns and disruptions, some of which had delayed effects that weren\'t immediately apparent in the first half of the year as ransomware victims and the cybersecurity industry grappled with catastrophic attacks.</p><p>\"Don\'t get me wrong: For everyone who\'s a defender or an incident responder, it\'s been a year,\" Burns Koven says. \"But it is noteworthy that for the major attacks that occurred last year, those groups don\'t exist anymore or have been laying low. There\'s been a strong signal from law enforcement that if you cross the line, there\'s going to be consequences.?</p><p>US and UK law enforcement scored two significant disruptions of major ransomware groups around the beginning of 2024: Six days before Christmas of 2023, the FBI announced that it had found vulnerabilities in the encryption software used by the group known as BlackCat or AlphV, distributed decryption keys to victims to foil the group\'s extortion tactics, and taken down the dark-web sites the group had used to issue its threats. Two months later, in February of 2024, the UK?s National Crime Agency carried out an operation against the notorious ransomware group Lockbit, hijacking its infrastructure, seizing its cryptocurrency wallets, taking down its dark-web sites, and even obtaining information about its members and cybercriminal partners.</p><p>Initially, however, both groups seemed to bounce back from those busts. AlphV in February announced that it had hacked Change Healthcare, disabling payments at hundreds of US clinics and pharmacies and extracting $22 million from the United Healthcare-owned company in one of the worst health-care-related ransomware incidents in history. Lockbit, too, seemed to shake off the NCA?s blows, immediately launching a new dark-web site where it continued to extort victims old and new.</p><p>But in fact, both law enforcement operations may have been more successful than they appeared. AlphV, after receiving its $22 million ransom from Change Healthcare, pulled a so-called \"exit scam,? taking the money and disappearing rather than sharing it with the hacker partners who had carried out the Change breach. Lockbit, too, largely fell off the map in the months that followed the NCA?s takedown, due perhaps to the cybercriminal underground\'s distrust of the group and its alleged leader, Dmitry Khoroshev, when it became clear the NCA had identified him. In May of 2024, Khoroshev was also sanctioned by the US Treasury, making it far more legally complicated for Lockbit victims to pay a ransom to the group.</p><p>While the vacuum left behind by those major players in the ransomware ecosystem was filled by newer groups during the second half of 2024, many of them didn?t have the skills or experience to go after targets as big and as well defended as Lockbit and AlphV had, says Burns Koven. The result, she says, was far smaller ransom payments, often in the tens of thousands of dollars rather than the millions or tens of millions.</p><p>\"Their talent is not quite as robust as their predecessors,\" Burns Koven says of the newer generation of ransomware gangs. \"We\'re seeing the hangover of these law enforcement takedowns, not just directly targeting individuals and strains of malware but also the infrastructure and tools and services that had been used to help perpetuate these attacks.?</p><p>Last year actually saw more ransomware incidents than the previous year, says Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst focused on ransomware at the security firm Recorded Future. The firm counted 4,634 attacks in 2024 versus 4,400 in 2023. But the lower ransom amounts received by those newer ransomware groups suggests they may have been favoring quantity over quality, he says. \"What we\'re seeing in terms of payments is a reflection of newer threat actors being attracted by the amount of money that they see you can make in ransomware, trying to get into the game and not being very good at it,? Liska says.</p><p>In addition to major law enforcement actions at the beginning of 2024, Chainalysis attributes the decline in payments during the second half of the year to heightened global awareness about the threat of ransomware, leading to more mature defenses and response plans within governments and other institutions. And Burns Koven adds that cryptocurrency regulation and law enforcement crackdowns on money laundering infrastructure, including mixers that help criminals anonymize and obfuscate the source of their ill-gotten cryptocurrencies, have also eroded ransomware actors? abilities to handle payments without specialized knowledge.</p><p>While the decline in payments during the second half of 2024 is significant for being the largest ever in Chainalysis\' data, the number of ransomware attacks and volume of payments has fluctuated and declined before. Notably, researchers saw a marked decrease in activity in 2022, a year in which Chainalysis placed total ransomware payments at $655 million compared to $1.07 billion in 2021 and nearly $1 billion in 2020. But while governments and defenders were initially heartened that their deterrence efforts were working, ransomware surged back as an even more dire threat in 2023, totaling, by Chainalysis\' count, $1.25 billion in payments that year.</p><p>\"I think ebbs and flows are inevitable,\" says Brett Callow, a managing director at FTI Consulting and longtime ransomware researcher. \"If the baddies had a couple of brilliant quarters, a dip will follow, same as if the goodies had some good quarters. That\'s why we really need to analyze trends over a longer period, because increases and decreases over shorter periods don\'t really tell us much.?</p><p>Additionally, researchers have long warned that it is difficult to get truly reliable numbers about the volume of ransomware attacks and an accurate total of payments each year. This is partly the result of attackers attempting to inflate their records and make themselves seem more effective and menacing by claiming old data breaches as new attacks or simply making up attacks that they haven\'t actually carried out. And it is always difficult to get accurate numbers about ransomware (not to mention digital scams more broadly), because stigma and regulatory requirements often keep victims from coming forward. This makes ransomware forecasting more of an art than a science.</p><p>\"My vibe from the second half of 2024 is that if there was a decrease, there will also be a rebound,\" Callow says.</p><p>Chainalysis researchers are clear that the 2024 payment decline is not a guarantee of future reductions in ransomware attacks. But Burns Coven emphasizes that for defenders who are in the trenches on incident response, the data point is useful for making the case that sustained investment in ransomware defense is worthwhile.</p><p>\"We\'re still standing in the rubble, right? We can\'t go tell everyone, everything\'s great, we solved ransomware, they\'re continuing to go after schools, after hospitals and critical infrastructure,\" says Burns Koven. But, she adds, \"I don\'t think anybody\'s necessarily celebrating. I think it\'s a signal of what work needs to be continued.\"</p>', '3_ransomware.png', 3, 3, 2, '2025-02-05', '2025-02-05'),
(4, 'Galaxy S25 Ultra Review: Greatest Phone Screen Ever, but Let\'s Not Talk About the AI', 'S25 Ultra: Greatest Screen Ever', '<p>With the new Galaxy S25 Ultra in my hand, I stand in the lobby of the LinkedIn building in San Francisco, which happens to be a POPOS: a privately owned public open space. It\'s a gorgeous hall, with long running panels of blonde wood on the ceiling and back wall. I use Samsung\'s new ultrawide camera to capture a dramatic photo of the lobby, and I\'m pleased with how it turns out. The ultrawide\'s lens makes the space\'s long lines look like they go on for eternity, and I can even make out details in the wood grain. To keep the positive vibes flowing, I decide to add the photo to the S25 Ultra\'s new Gemini AI assistant, and test the \"Talk Live about this\" feature. That\'s when things go sideways.</p><p>With the confidence of a 6-year-old telling a lie, Gemini explains that my photo is of the Miner Auditorium at the de Young Museum. Fun fact: The de Young Museum doesn\'t have a Miner Auditorium. Even more fun fact: There\'s a Miner Auditorium at SFJazz, but my photo was taken in LinkedIn\'s lobby. To quote Charlie Brown, \"Good grief!\"</p><p>At a time when companies push AI as the main appeal of their products, Samsung launches the $1,300 Galaxy S25 Ultra and touts the hell out of its AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which, well, see above. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year\'s Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag.</p><p>Notably, the S25 Ultra marks another step away from the Galaxy Note influenced design that Samsung has embraced since the S22 Ultra. Samsung\'s refinements to the Galaxy S25 Ultra feel a bit like Pete Davidson getting all his tattoos removed: I miss those chaotic, wild days from them both a few years ago. Where\'s the Samsung that actually printed \"Space Zoom 100x\" on the S20 Ultra\'s camera bump? Or the Samsung that made a nearly three-minute video explaining how black the Phantom Black Galaxy S21 Ultra was?</p><p>The result is that the S25 Ultra is lighter and more comfortable to hold, but also about as exciting to look at as someone wearing a pair of Dockers and a polo shirt. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is undoubtedly a wonderful phone -- its performance is jaw-dropping and it offers the most versatile phone camera you can find today. But before you buy one, consider why you\'d want to.</p><p>If you want to get the S25 Ultra for its AI features, don\'t. While Samsung and Google\'s AI does offer you squint-your-eyes glimpses at what could be, they aren\'t the reason you buy an Ultra ? at least this year.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra\'s appeal is muddied by its $1,300, ?1,249 and AU$2,149 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit.</p><p>The reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I\'ve seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it\'s ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.</p><p>But $1,300 is a lot, and this phone doesn\'t even fold in half.</p><p>If you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It\'s harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone\'s battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don\'t need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.</p><p>When I wake the phone, I\'m greeted with the new Now Bar at the bottom of the lock screen. I like the carousel interface, which shows a shortcut to my Now Brief and information from other background apps like directions from Google Maps or the live score of an NBA game. But unlike the iPhone and its Live Activities, the Now Bar is limited and can\'t track a rideshare.</p><p>Now Brief is a new interface/widget that lives on the home screen and is all about you. It uses data from your phone including your calendar, email and photos, as well as connected devices like a Galaxy Watch, to give you a snapshot at the start of your day or as your day progresses. In theory, it should get to know you better over time, but after two weeks of testing, it largely just shows me the weather, my calendar, photos I took and a random news story which more often than not is tied to politics. I don\'t want to read about Mike Lindell when I first wake up ? or ever, really.</p><p>But it\'s the Ultra\'s cross-app functionality through Gemini that has the most potential. I can ask Gemini in a single prompt to search for upcoming Air Jordan 1 sneaker drops and add them to a note, and it works. I had Gemini search my email for a list of upcoming soccer practices and add each practice to my calendar. Again, no problemo.</p><p>All three Galaxy S25 models have the same AI features. This is one area where Samsung could have helped the Ultra stand out from its siblings by having a unique AI feature that the others don\'t. Side note: You can do a lot of this on other Android phones by just using Gemini and Google apps. But the issue, like with a lot of AI, is when things go haywire.</p><p>I asked Gemini to find a GIF of Homer Simpson walking backward into bushes and send it to a friend. It found a link to the GIF online and sent it to my friend, but it forgot to include the actual link. So my friend received a message that read, \"Here is a link to a GIF online of Homer Simpson walking back into bushes.\"</p><p>Beyond reliability, another obstacle to this hybrid online/on-device assistant is us. We\'re used to the one-step-at-a-time reality that our phones have had for nearly two decades. So having a digital assistant that\'s capable of more complex queries is going to take some rewiring in our brains before we can fully take advantage of it. </p><p>The S25 Ultra now has flat sides, which makes me feel more confident that it won\'t slip out of my hand. Samsung reduced the overall mass compared to previous versions, too. The phone is 15 grams lighter than the S24 Ultra, which makes the S25 Ultra seem less like I\'m carrying a tech-infused brick around with me.</p><p>Samsung increased the screen real estate an extra tenth of an inch to 6.9 inches, thanks to thinner bezels. This, along with an antireflective coating, make the S25 Ultra\'s screen my favorite on any phone. Content looks immersive even with something as mundane as a news or social feed. Using it outdoors to take a picture is fantastic because it\'s bright, and the lack of glare doesn\'t interfere with seeing what the photos I\'m taking are going to look like, even in direct sunlight.</p><p>The S Pen no longer has Bluetooth connectivity, and as a consequence doesn\'t have the Air Actions found on previous S Pens for the Ultra and Note series. If you don\'t know what Air Actions are, you\'re not alone, as apparently less than 1% of Ultra owners ever used them. The lack of Bluetooth means that the S Pen cannot be used as a remote camera shutter either. </p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra has four lenses on the back: a wide, an ultrawide, a 3X telephoto and a 5X telephoto. On the front is a 12-megapixel selfie camera. All of the cameras, except the ultrawide, are the same as what the S24 Ultra has and take just as amazing photos.</p><p>I want to focus on what\'s new, and at the top of that list is the S25 Ultra\'s 50-megapixel ultrawide camera. It\'s simply amazing for a phone. The lens hits that sweet spot between distorting things in-frame enough to look dramatic without giving photos that warped-edge fisheye look. The higher resolution sensor captures a lot of detail. The dynamic range is good, but still a step down from the 200-megapixel main camera.</p><p>Take a look at the photo below of Peebles the cat that I took with the ultrawide. Despite Peebles dashing to his window bed, the phone caught a ton of detail in his fur and whiskers. This image has some challenging lighting, with sunshine pouring through the window at the left into an otherwise dark room. Notice the image noise in the shadows on the right side. Perfect? No, but the detail and lens dramatic distortion make up for it.</p><p>Below is an image I took with the ultrawide of a water sculpture early in the morning. The flowing water looks like glass contrasted against the stone. This image is over-sharpened, but I like how the sun flare looks in the top right corner.</p><p>The S25 Ultra\'s ultrawide doubles as a macro lens, allowing it to get close to a subject while keeping things in focus ? it even crops the image\'s frame to match that of the main camera. In the photo below of a Godzilla toy on a window sill, the monster\'s plastic texture shows up well. Also the S25 Ultra balanced exposing the image of Godzilla without blowing out the highlights of the sky and cityscape in the window.</p><p>Samsung nailed the Galaxy S25 Ultra\'s video features. There\'s a new zoom slider built for video recording, which makes doing a long steady zoom feel more controlled than the previous zoom dial.</p><p>There\'s the Audio Eraser tool that helps you minimize background noise, like music or wind, and makes your subject\'s voice stand out more. I tried this tool at several different places and was impressed with the results every time. But don\'t get me wrong, this won\'t remove all background noises. I mean, it can, but that usually results in the subject\'s voice sounding odd and digitized.</p><p>Samsung improved night time video capture on the S25 Ultra, and it\'s noticeable, especially compared to the S24 Ultra. Though phone video recorded in low-light on any phone is still OK at best.</p><p>The S25 Ultra can record video in Log format ? this is aimed at filmmakers and creative types, and most people will likely skip trying it out. Log video looks flat and desaturated but it retains more image information for highlights and shadows, allowing for greater flexibility to edit colors and retain dynamic range after recording.</p><p>At the heart of the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a custom version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and 12GB of RAM. In everyday use, animations look smooth, video games look incredible and AI runs quickly. Samsung actually made improvements to its photo AI tools by having them run on-device, instead of in the cloud and the increased speed is definitely noticeable.</p><p>But in terms of absolute power, the S25 Ultra, its custom chip and its larger cooling system lead to some absolutely wild performance. In the Geekbench 6 benchmark test for the CPU, the S25 Ultra scored higher than any phone we\'ve ever tested, including the OnePlus 13 and iPhone 16 Pro. The same is true when it comes to the 3DMark Wild Life Extreme benchmark test for graphics.</p>', '4_s25review.png', 4, 3, 5, '2025-02-05', '2025-02-05'),
(5, 'Transportation Has Gotten Greener, but There\'s a Long Way to Go', 'Transportation Hasn\'t Gone Green Enough', '<p>From wildfires in Canada to flooding in India, people across the world are dealing with the realities of climate change. The world recorded its highest temperatures ever this summer and the climate models for 2100 make sobering reading.</p><p>To tackle climate change we need a data-driven approach, using technology to help decarbonize the sectors that contribute to it. The transportation sector is the largest contributor to climate change in the US and Europe. Simply put, travel is in need of a long-overdue update. The good news is that, in 2024, we will kickstart that much needed moment for green mobility.</p><p>The International Energy Agency estimates 55 percent of the reductions needed to cut all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 are linked to everyday consumer choices, particularly driving.</p><p>Over two-thirds of consumers cite the lack of electric charging stations as the biggest barrier to buying electric vehicles (EVs). However, new legislation, such as the European Green Deal and universal EV charging standards in the US, will help to put new chargers on the road.</p><p>The infrastructure is growing, but the information is still catching up. That\'s why, to empower drivers with the information they need, Google has updated its Search experience to make it easier to research the costs and incentives associated with EVs. Google Maps also shows nearby EV chargers and offers eco-friendly routing, providing directions optimized for fuel or battery efficiency. In 2024, drivers will not only be able to more easily purchase an electric vehicle, they will be able to more easily charge them. The theory is simple: When billions of people have the tools to make more informed decisions, meaningful change is possible.</p><p>The impact of individuals grows exponentially when coupled with systemic investments by government officials and business leaders. We all know the feeling of impatience when waiting for the light to turn green. It\'s not just an inconvenience, it\'s bad for the environment - US Department of Energy data suggests that eliminating idling vehicles is equivalent to taking 5 million cars off American roads. In partnership with local governments, Google (where I am the chief sustainability officer) recently expanded Project Green Light - which leverages AI to improve traffic light efficiency - to 12 cities around the world. Early results show there\'s potential to reduce the number of vehicle stops by up to 30 percent, lowering emissions for up to 30 million car trips monthly.\nYet, we cannot focus exclusively on cars - providing sustainable public transport is also vital. Nowhere is the value clearer than in Japan, a leader in high-speed rail. One passenger traveling between Tokyo and Osaka emits 4.2 kilograms of carbon dioxide - one-twelfth the emissions of a passenger on a Tokyo-Osaka flight. That\'s why it\'s so important for people to have information on alternative, climate-friendly modes of transport at their fingertips - including comparable train routes, biking, and walking suggestions. This also illustrates the potential impact of projects like the Brightline train, designed to connect Los Angeles and Las Vegas by electric, high-speed rail.</p><p>Along with opportunities on roads and rails, in 2024 we will make progress on our skies. Aviation is responsible for 3.5 percent of global warming?35 percent of which is non-emissions related. The culprit? Contrails - the feathery white trails created by airplanes. They may look harmless, but they trap heat inside the Earth\'s atmosphere. Using AI-based technology, Google partnered with American Airlines and Breakthrough Energy to reduce contrails by 54 percent, achieving the first proof point of verifiable and cost-effective contrail avoidance. Delta Airlines, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and others are also working to tackle the issue. In 2024, clean mobility will move closer to the norm across transportation, not the exception.</p>', '5_greenTransport.png', 5, 3, 2, '2024-06-19', '2024-06-19'),
(6, '\'I Have Always Felt the World Was a Harsh Place\': Elden Ring\'s Hidetaka Miyazaki on Why He May Never Stop Making Games', 'Elden Ring\'s Miyazaki May Never Stop Making Games', '<p>Much has changed for Hidetaka Miyazaki in the past 10 years. In May 2014, he was made president of FromSoftware - the Japanese game developer known for its breakout dark fantasy hits Demon\'s Souls (2009), Dark Souls (2011) and Bloodborne (2015), all games he himself directed. Back then, FromSoftware\'s games were critical darlings with devoted followings, but they were not enormous bestsellers, shifting a few million copies each. But in 2022, the company released the splendid, imperious Elden Ring, a collaboration with fantasy writer George RR Martin that is not only Miyazaki\'s masterpiece but also by far his most popular work: to date it has sold 25m copies. FromSoftware is no longer a niche maker of cult hits. It is now the home of a genuine blockbuster.</p><p>Has this changed Miyazaki\'s outlook? Perhaps unsurprisingly, given how unforgiving and cold his games? worlds are, he is not the most optimistic person you\'ll ever meet. \"Elden Ring was in a league of its own in terms of the success and critical acclaim that it has seen, but what we try to do as a company is never assume that will happen again with our future games,\" he tells me in an interview in Los Angeles. \"No decision is based on any assumption that, hey, we did it once, it\'s going to happen again. Allowing for this rather conservative forecast gives us room to fail - and that in turn results in better games and better decisions. In a roundabout way, I think that assumption of not making another hit, that conservative outlook, is fueling and aiding our game design.\"</p><p>Perhaps it\'s just as well that neither Miyazaki nor his team at FromSoftware is getting too comfortable. It\'s difficult to imagine them creating such powerfully demanding, ambitious and occasionally cruel games if they did.</p><p>A major expansion for Elden Ring, entitled Shadow of the Erdtree, releases today: it takes players to the forbidding Lands of Shadow, whose amber skies and assortment of awe-inspiringly grotesque monsters and vengeful, forgotten warriors are like an forlorn echo of the original game\'s Lands Between. All of FromSoftware\'s games are notoriously challenging, requiring uncommon reserves of grit, determination and willingness from their players - and Shadow of the Erdtree may well be the most difficult yet, putting even those with 100 hours of experience in the Lands Between on the back foot. But it rewards persistence beautifully, with its intricate, fascinatingly opaque story and memorable fights against formidable beings, from dragons embellished in ghostly fronds to giant walking baskets of human cinders. The sense of achievement that you feel when you finally conquer the unconquerable in a Miyazaki game is still unmatched elsewhere.</p><p>Erdtree\'s punishing nature feels like being doused in cold water for me, because - and maybe this is just because I\'ve been playing these games for 15 years - Elden Ring actually felt that little bit more approachable than other FromSoftware games. If you\'re stuck somewhere, you can ride off somewhere else rather than flinging yourself at the same near-impossible boss over and over again; you have more options, and there\'s always a different approach to try. As I put it to Miyazaki, it doesn\'t feel like you\'re having your face pushing into the dirt all the time. Does he think this is part of why Elden Ring found a bigger audience than Dark Souls, or 2019\'s shinobi fantasy Sekiro?</p><p>\"It\'s certainly part of the intention. Elden Ring, by its open world nature and game design, lends the player more freedom,\" he muses. \"At no point during the game did we want players to feel claustrophobic or overly limited in the scope of what they\'re able to do and experience in that world. Instead of the very grim, dark fantasy that you may be used to from past FromSoftware games - it still has that same harshness and coldness, but we wanted to have these moments of beauty. That\'s where a little bit of high fantasy comes in, conceptually. Both in terms of the difficulty and the learning curve, as well as the world setting, you feel that you can come up for air.\"</p><p>Every new FromSoftware release spawns a mini-discourse about difficulty and accessibility in modern games. Some developers choose to offer less challenging modes for inexperienced or time-poor players, even occasionally going so far as to remove enemies from a game entirely. This is not something that would work for a game such as Elden Ring, however; the challenge is the entire point, and dialing it down would compromise it creatively.</p><p>\"If we really wanted the whole world to play the game, we could just crank the difficulty down more and more. But that wasn\'t the right approach,\" says Miyazaki. \"Had we taken that approach, I don\'t think the game would have done what it did, because the sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy - which, in my eyes, would break the game itself.\"</p><p>Improvement through failure is not just a game design principle for Miyazaki: it\'s something of a personal philosophy. As company president, he creates a work environment that allows for developers to experiment, for ideas to go nowhere; no one project carries the developer\'s entire future. His own big break came when he was handed control of a struggling fantasy project at FromSoftware back in 2006: the game that eventually became Demon\'s Souls. \"I figured if I could find a way to take control of the game, I could turn it into anything I wanted,\" he told the Guardian\'s Simon Parkin back in 2015. \"Best of all, if my ideas failed, nobody would care - it was already a failure.\"</p><p>\"Frankly, I don\'t think it\'s that different now from when I was making Demon\'s Souls 15 years ago,\" he says with a laugh when I remind him of this. \"What I try to foster in our own environment is making sure these younger directors and game designers have a similar experience to what I did when I was working on Demon\'s Souls, where, well, if this game fails, it\'s not the end of the world. I think that mental state and attitude is what helps people grow.\"</p><p>Miyazaki himself is different, though. I first met him in 2011, at the Tokyo Game Show, shortly before the release of Dark Souls, the game that would catapult him into the spotlight. Quiet and soft-spoken, his eyes fixed mostly on the carpet, he was uncomfortable being the center of attention; he is much more confident now, comfortable talking about both business and game design. When he is thinking, he now looks up at the ceiling, rather than down at the floor. He is father to a young daughter now, as well as heading a company. Like Dark Souls\' and Elden Ring\'s players, he has grown into a more capable version of himself.</p><p>But he\'s still as hands-on a game designer as he ever was. \"There is always going to be this enjoyment and satisfaction I get out of making games, regardless of what my title or position in the company is,\" he tells me. \"I enjoy helping grow and nurture the younger directors whom I see guiding the company in the next stage. But sitting in a management office all day isn\'t my style. I really get my hands dirty and continue to make games together, through which I hope I can communicate my process to a different generation of talent. I have had the title of president for almost 10 years now, but I would say about 95% of what I do at the company and how I spend my time is directed towards making games and directing games. Using that ratio, you could say I only actually have about six months? experience as an executive!\"</p><p>The world is a different place than it was when Demon\'s Souls broke out, too. I have wondered whether more people are connecting with Miyazaki and FromSoftware\'s work now because we are somewhat used to a sense of disempowerment. Bleakness is not so unfamiliar a state of being to anyone who has lived through the past 15 years of pandemics, political upheaval and encroaching climate disaster. What Elden Ring offers is a spark of hope that, perhaps, if you are strong and persistent enough, you can triumph regardless.</p><p>\"A lot of FromSoftware games throw players into this barren wasteland, and it\'s a very severe, harsh, cold experience - I don\'t think what we\'ve been doing in our games has changed, but perhaps the world has come closer to that type of feeling,\" agrees Miyazaki. \"These past few years have been a huge exception to the rule in terms of what\'s happening around us. But even before that, I have always felt that the world was quite a harsh place. I\'ve always lived my life with that worldview, those values. So this idea of being thrust into a wasteland and planting the seeds of growth is something that, for me, feels almost universal. Perhaps more people are discovering that right now.\"</p><p>I think that\'s something a lot of people miss about FromSoftware games: the sense of hope. In my first interview with Miyazaki, over email back in 2010, he told me about the origin of Demon\'s Souls\' unusual multiplayer, wherein players can summon anonymous helpers to help them through a particularly horrible area or boss encounter. He was in his car in winter, trying to get up a hill, and everyone got stuck; only when they started working together, with everybody behind pushing the car in front to the top of the hill, did anyone make it up. He called it \"a connection of mutual assistance between transient people\", and added: \"Oddly, that incident will probably linger in my heart for a long time. Simply because it\'s fleeting, it stays with you a lot longer.\"</p><p>Elden Ring, too, is full of moments of fleeting beauty and camaraderie like this - and it\'s because they are rare that they feel meaningful. In a harsh world, moments of respite are to be treasured.</p><p>\"I am sure that there is some experience, if you look deep enough into my history, that has informed my identity, the worldview that drives me to make the games that I do,\" says Miyazaki. \"I\'ve never taken a step back and looked at what may have been the trigger, but I\'m sure there is some reason why these are the types of games that I want to see and make. If I were to look in the mirror and reflect on myself - if I go on this soul-searching journey to find out why, I might be disappointed in myself. It would force me to come face to face with how boring and average a person I am. Perhaps I intentionally avoid doing that. It keeps the creative spring flowing.\"</p><p>I can\'t help but smile at this answer. Of course: if he understood it fully, it wouldn\'t be as interesting. You could say the exact same thing about any of his games. No matter how much time we spend with them, they retain an air of mystery that keeps them fascinating.</p><p>It is rare for FromSoftware to make a sequel (the Dark Souls trilogy is an exception to the rule). Elden Ring will not be getting one: Shadow of the Erdtree is the end of the story. Whatever Miyazaki\'s next project is, it will be different. Has he made his dream game yet?</p><p>\"Let\'s just say for the record that I am planning on making that game,\" he replies. As to whether or not his next game will be as big a hit as Elden Ring - characteristically, he has no expectations.</p><p>\"If I were to produce some kind of catastrophic failure, I would say, looking back on my career ? well, you know, I\'ve had my shot, and I\'d be OK with that. Perhaps I\'ve done enough in the industry and in this space,\" he says, with the hint of a smile. \"Looking back, I\'ve had many chances, and I think I\'ve exercised a lot of them quite well. Maybe that would simply be the end of my chapter.\"</p>', '6_eldenRing.png', 6, 4, 3, '2024-06-21', '2024-06-21');

It isn\'t planning on closing any factories, for example, which likely irked Honda considering it was looking for wholesale change.</p><p>Nissan shares jumped as much as 8.7% in afternoon trading in Tokyo on Thursday.</p><p>Walking away from the tie-up with Honda is a huge gamble for Nissan, whose outdated product lineup has forced it to discount heavily, destroying its bottom line. The automaker, which will report third-quarter earnings next week, announced a 94% drop in net income for the first half and has said it will need to dismiss 9,000 workers and cut a fifth of its manufacturing capacity.</p><p>That precarious financial situation isn\'t likely to appeal to many would-be suitors.</p><p>If Nissan doesn\'t find a partner to help put it back on a stronger footing after the partial unwinding of its complex 25-year strategic partnership with Renault SA, it may need a rescue ? as it did with the French automaker.</p><p>Ending the exclusive discussions with Honda, meanwhile, would let either party walk away without having to pay a hefty cancellation fee of ?100 billion ($657 million), according to the companies? memorandum of understanding on Dec. 23.</p><p>Nissan\'s board is pushing Uchida and other senior managers to develop a more comprehensive restructuring plan in parallel to discussions with any potential new partner, the people said.</p><p>The goal is to come up with a much deeper revamp in time for Feb. 13, when the maker of Altimas and Pathfinders is scheduled to report quarterly results. That\'s also when the board will meet to formalize its decision, one person said. Honda reports its third-quarter earnings that day too.</p><p>Nissan has struggled to regain its footing since the 2018 arrest and purge of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn on charges of underreporting compensation. That upended Nissan\'s alliance with Renault and the subsequent score-settling fueled an exodus of top management, leaving reduced bandwidth to focus on the actual business of selling cars.</p><p>The scope of Nissan\'s financial crisis became obvious to the broader public in November, when the automaker also slashed its annual profit guidance by 70%.</p><p>Any new restructuring plans must go beyond those figures. \"Further earnings deterioration is possible at Nissan,? Citigroup analyst Arifumi Yoshida said. \"Additional restructuring measures are vital.?</p><p>Despite its woes, Nissan\'s vast manufacturing operations and household brand name remain a draw.</p><p>Hon Hai Precision Industry, the maker of iPhones also known as Foxconn that is trying to establish a foothold in outsourced manufacturing of electric vehicles, approached Nissan about acquiring a stake in the company in December but ultimately put its interest on hold when it became clear that the Japanese automaker was in negotiations for a potential merger with Honda.</p><p>But the electronics contract manufacturer didn\'t give up completely, the people familiar with the matter said, preferring to see if the two could make legitimate progress toward a deal before deciding on its next move.</p>', '12_nissan.jpg', 10, 2, 3, '2025-02-06', '2025-02-06'),

Some workers wonder how much longer they\'ll have jobs, while business leaders say the uncertainty has already led many investors to start tightening their purse strings.</p><p>\"It?s a conflict between governments and we\'re the ones most affected,? said 58-year-old truck driver Carlos Ponce, leaning against his rig at the customs border crossing between Ciudad Ju?rez and El Paso, Texas. \"Tomorrow, who knows what will happen??</p><p>Ponce, who was driving a truck full of car shock absorbers, said he\'s spent the past 35 years moving goods across the border, just as his father did before him. Now, he\'s unsure how much longer that will last.</p><p>\nManufacturing in export-oriented assembly plants known as maquiladoras are the heart of Ciudad Juárez\'s economy, with 97% of its goods going to the U.S., according to figures from Mexico?s Economic Ministry.</p><p>The factories were born in the 1960s in an attempt to boost economic development in northern Mexico and lower prices for U.S. consumers. The maquiladora program later took off after the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, was signed in 1994. The agreement was supplanted by a similar pact, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, negotiated between the three countries during Trump\'s first term.</p><p>Today, neon signs with the dollar-to-peso exchange rate flash across the city, a reminder of the close ties binding both sides of the border.</p><p>\"Everything that happens in the United States: its economic, social policy ? directly affects us because companies here in Mexico depend on what they sell in the United States,? said Thor Salayandia, head of his family\'s auto-parts manufacturing facility in Ciudad Juárez. \"The United States also needs Mexico to keep manufacturing, but they?re not seeing things like that.?</p><p>This week, workers and business leaders alike breathed a sigh of relief when Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced she had negotiated with Trump to delay tariffs one month.</p><p>\"Now, we\'re buying time,?

That economic interdependence has left many in the city struggling to imagine a future without it. One U.S. company said it would likely have to move part of its manufacturing in the city to the U.S., but at a sharp cost.</p><p>Antonio Ruiz, a compliance officer at Tecma, a U.S. firm that helps foreign companies set up shop along the border, said his was among a number of businesses to call emergency meetings over the weekend as economic forecasters warned that the tariffs could drive Mexico into a recession.</p><p>\"It\'s very difficult to be prepared for something that has never happened before,? Ruiz said. \"As much as you want to prepare for it, the best you can do is prepare to brace yourself in the short term.?</p><p>Salayandia and economists warn that any sort of tax could lead to cascading unemployment and rising prices on both sides of the border. In Mexico, they say, it could also spur a rise in violence in border areas by pushing the unemployed into the hands of drug cartels, as well as an increase in Mexican migration to the U.S.</p><p>Manuel Sotelo, a leader of Mexico\'s National Chamber of Freight Transportation who owns a fleet of trucks that cross the border every day, sees the tariff threats as more of a political power move than a future economic reality.</p><p>\"Both countries would be paralyzed,? said Sotelo, who sat at a desk covered with local newspapers carrying bold headlines on the tariffs, a Trump bobblehead positioned behind him. \"Let\'s say he did slap a 25% tariff (on Mexico), what would they do during the Super Bowl without avocados??</p><p>On the other hand, Sotelo acknowledges that the tariff talk has already inflicted some damage. He and other business leaders say that over the past year they\'ve watched investment dip in Ciudad Juárez because of political uncertainty, as investors hesitate to funnel their money into businesses that could collapse with the stroke of a pen in Washington.</p><p>While Trump\'s election has been the primary driver of that uncertainty, June elections in Mexico and a controversial judicial reform carried out by Mexico\'s governing party have added to it. Sotelo said he saw a 7% drop in business last year, and only expects that to continue until lingering tariff threats are resolved.</p><p>One collective of maquiladoras in the city says it has seen at least three factories halt production.</p><p>\"Every time we hear this discourse from political leaders, the people running our governments, it sends shock waves through the border,?

Those include Walt Disney Co., McDonald\'s, Ford, Walmart, Target, Lowe\'s and John Deere.</p><p>Trump\'s recent executive order threatens to impose financial sanctions on federal contractors deemed to have \"illegal\" DEI programs. If the companies are found to be in violation, they could be subject to massive damages under the 1863 False Claims Act. That law states that contractors that make false claims to the government could be liable for three times the government\'s damages.</p><p>The order also directed all federal agencies to choose the targets of up to nine investigations of publicly traded companies, large non-profits and other institutions with DEI policies that constitute \"Illegal discrimination or preference.\"</p><p>The challenge for companies is knowing which DEI policies the Trump administration may decide are \"illegal.\" Trump\'s executive order seeks to \"terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs? and other activities of the federal government, and to compel federal agencies \"to \'combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.\'\"</p><p>In both the public and private sector, diversity initiatives have covered a range of practices, from anti-discrimination training and conducting pay equity studies to making efforts to recruit more members of minority groups and women as employees.</p><p>Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, has tried to hire more people from underrepresented groups for more than a decade but stepped up those efforts in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis triggered an outcry for more social justice.</p><p>Shortly after Floyd died, Pichai set a goal to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in the Mountain View, California, company\'s largely Asian and white leadership ranks by 30% by 2025.

But it\'s the haters that companies like Mark Zuckerberg\'s Meta worry about.</p><p>In an era when online anger and social tensions are increasingly directed at the businesses consumers count on, Meta last year spent $24.4 million on guards, alarms and other measures to keep Zuckerberg and the company\'s former chief operating officer safe.</p><p>Some high-profile CEOs surround themselves with security. But the fatal shooting this week of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson while he walked alone on a New York City sidewalk has put a spotlight on the widely varied approaches companies take in protecting their leaders against threats.</p><p>Thompson had no personal security and appeared unaware of the shooter lurking before he was gunned down.</p><p>And today\'s political, economic and technological climate is only going to make the job of evaluating threats against executives and taking action to protect them even more difficult, experts say.</p><p>\"We are better today at collecting signals. I\'m not sure we\'re any better at making sense of the signals we collect,\" says Fred Burton of Ontic, a provider of threat management software for companies.</p><p>After Thompson\'s shooting, Burton said, \"I\'ve been on the phone all day with some organizations asking for consultation, saying, \'Am I doing enough?\'</p><p>Since the killing, some health insurers have taken steps to safeguard their executives and rank-and-file workers.</p><p>Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, said Friday it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons and will have its employees work from home.</p><p>\"Although we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>A Medica spokesman said the company had also removed biographical information about its executives from its website as a precaution.</p><p>UnitedHealth Group, parent of the insurer Thompson led, removed photos of its top executives from its website hours after the shooting, later removing their names and biographies.</p><p>But well before the attack, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives.</p><p>Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.</p><p>Zuckerberg \"is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,\" the Menlo Park, California, company explained earlier this year in an annual shareholder disclosure.</p><p>At Apple, the world\'s largest tech company by stock valuation, CEO Tim Cook was tormented by a stalker who sent him sexually provocative emails and even showed up outside his Silicon Valley home at one point before the company\'s security team successfully took legal action against her in 2022.</p><p>Cook is regularly accompanied by security personnel when he appears in public. Still, the company\'s $820,000 allotted last year to protect top executives is a fraction of what other tech giants spent for CEO security.</p><p>Just over a quarter of the companies in the Fortune 500 reported spending money to protect their CEOs and other top executives. Of those that did, the median payment for personal security doubled over the last three years to about $98,000.</p><p>In many companies, investor meetings like the one UnitedHealthcare\'s Thompson was walking to when he was shot are viewed as very risky because details on the location and who will be speaking are highly publicized.</p><p>\"It gives people an opportunity to arrive well in advance and take a look at the room, take a look at how people would probably come and go out of a location,\" said Dave Komendat, president of DSKomendat Risk Management Services, which is based in the greater Seattle area.</p><p>Some firms respond by beefing up security. For example, tech companies routinely require everyone attending a major event, such as Apple\'s annual unveiling of the next iPhone or a shareholder meeting, to go through airport-style security checkpoints before entering.</p><p>Others forgo in-person meetings with shareholders. Government health insurance provider Centene Corp. joined that group Thursday, citing the UnitedHealthcare executive?s death in announcing that its upcoming Investor Day will be held online, rather than in-person as originally planned.</p><p>\"But there are also company cultures that really frown on that and want their leaders to be accessible to people, accessible to shareholders, employees,\" Komendat said.</p><p>Depending on the company, such an approach may make sense. Many top executives are little known to the public, operating in industries and locations that make them far less prone to public exposure and to threats.</p><p>\"Determining the need for and appropriate level of an executive-level protection program is specific to each organization,\" says David Johnston, vice president of asset protection and retail operations at the National Retail Federation. \"These safeguards should also include the constant monitoring of potential threats and the ability to adapt to maintain the appropriate level of security and safety.\"</p><p>Some organizations have a protective intelligence group that uses digital tools such as machine learning or artificial intelligence to comb through online comments to detect threats not only on social media platforms such as X but also on the dark web, says Komendat. They look for what\'s being said about the company, its employees and its leadership to uncover risks.</p><p>\"There are always threats directed towards senior leaders at companies. Many of them are not credible,\" Komendat said. \"The question always is trying to determine what is a real threat versus what is someone just venting with no intent to take any additional action.\"</p><p>Burton, a former special agent with the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service, points out that despite the current climate, there is little in the way of organized groups that target companies.</p><p>Today, one of the primary worries are loners whose rantings online are fed by others who are like-minded. It\'s up to corporate security analysts to zero in on such dialogue and decide whether or not it represents a real threat.</p><p>And CEOs aren\'t the only targets of disgruntled customers. In the U.S., there were 525 workplace fatalities due to assault in 2022, according to the National Safety Council. Industries including healthcare, education and service providers are more prone to violence than others, and taxi drivers are more than 20 times more likely to be murdered on the job than other workers, the group said.</p><p>But the ambush of UnitedHealthcare\'s Thompson this week is bound to get some CEOs second-guessing.</p><p>\"What invariably happen at moments like this in time is you will get additional ears listening? to security professionals seeking money to beef up executive protection,\" Burton says.</p><p>\"Because I can guarantee you there\'s not a CEO in America who\'s not aware of this incident.\"</p>', '16_ceoKill.png', 13, 1, 9, '2024-12-06', '2024-12-06'),

This time, we have Pedro Pascal as super-stretchy Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as the transparent Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as the flame-headed Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as rock-dude Ben Grimm - whose cosmic mission delivers them all-new abilities. Check out the trailer here:</p><p>Phew! There\'s real pressure here for Marvel Studios to knock it out of the park with First Steps - and from the looks of things, they\'re on the right track. We\'ve gotta say, it\'s fantastic. (...say that again?) The vibe of this one is pure retro-futurism ? set in an alternate 1960s, and accentuating the fashion, art style, and pastel colours of the era. Matt Shakman is directing here, and given how artfully he recreated decades of sitcoms in every episode of WandaVision, he\'s now bringing those talents to his first Marvel feature film.</p><p>While this is just a first teaser, it offers tidbits of everything you want to see - the Four chilling out in the Baxter building; Johnny Storm flaming on; Sue Storm turning invisible; the Fantasticar whizzing through the streets; even robot H.E.R.B.I.E. (though, we\'re still no closer to finding out who\'s doing the voice there). Plus, we have The Thing cooking dinner - because, if you\'re going to cast Richie from The Bear, you gotta get him in the kitchen at least once. Corner! All that, and we got a brief, mysterious glimpse of a long-haired John Malkovich - and most excitingly of all, an early peek at big (and we mean big) bad Galactus. Chills. No sign, yet, though, of Reed\'s stretching abilities.</p><p>Will the Fantastic Four fare better on the big screen as part of the MCU? How will that actually enter the \'Sacred Timeline\' universe?

(19, 'The Cinematic Intermission Is Back In The Brutalist ? And It Should Stay', 'The Intermission Is Back', '<p>As a cinemagoer, you never want to be waiting for your film to end. The cause of such a feeling might be boredom, or an increasingly desperate toilet situation, or regret at not packing enough snacks. Most annoyingly, you might actually be enjoying whatever you\'re watching, just tinged with a niggling sensation that so-and-so self-indulgent auteur can\'t help but slightly outstay their welcome, losing you in the final act. For all those situations, there\'s an easy solution: an intermission. A mid-movie pause, so the audience can have a break, the story can reset, and everyone comes into Part 2 feeling energised. This, most wisely, is the choice taken by The Brutalist.</p><p>Brady Corbet?s heavily-Oscar-nommed, big-serious-drama epic clocks in at a ? fittingly ? brutal three hour and 35 minute runtime, true to its weighty ambitions. Brilliantly, 15 of those minutes constitute a mid-film intermission. This is not a cinema-dependent presentational flourish - it\'s a literal part of the movie, hard-baked into the film itself, with a countdown clock and everything. And it\'s used exactly as an intermission should be: not just an acknowledgement that 200 minutes is a bit of a bum-number, but that the story is better told, the audience more receptive, and the narrative arc of the film more cleanly delineated by that brief pause. It\'s a film with a very clear \'before\' and \'after\'. All hail the intermission.</p><p>It\'s an all-too-rare occurrence these days. After all, movie runtimes are - in general - getting longer, with your typical blockbuster more likely to clock in around 150 minutes than the sub-two-hour mark. That\'s not necessarily a bad thing - in a world where there\'s cause for concern around the global attention span, being able to immerse audiences and capture them for a reasonable period of time is an increasingly valuable commodity. But as a certified Long Movie Enjoyer? (my ideal film runtime is either 90 minutes or 180), I think intermissions should be deployed far more liberally.</p><p>Decades ago, the intermission was a staple part of a movie epic. But their rarity in contemporary cinema only makes their occasional usage more notable. Prior to The Brutalist, it was used in Quentin Tarantino\'s roadshow presentation of The Hateful Eight, a special release that was all about exaggerating the cinematic experience (screening in 70mm, with a four-minute opening overture too). He introduced it at the perfect time in the narrative - cranking up the tension through the first half, delivering some explosive violence at the end of \'Chapter 3\', and then letting viewers regroup before the bodies really start piling up in the second half. Zack Snyder, too, spoke about a 10-minute intermission for theatrical screenings of his XXL Snyder Cut of Justice League (a colossal four-hour behemoth); on the big-screen, RRR features an intermission (in keeping with much of Indian cinema). These are films that benefit from a pause, with plenty of ideal places to provide one.</p><p>You could say the same, though, about myriad other movies in recent memory - ones that specifically opted against the use of an intermission. Martin Scorsese, I\'m looking at you. End of Part One.</p><p>THIS ARTICLE WILL RESUME AFTER A BRIEF INTERMISSION</p><p>THIS ARTICLE CONTINUES IN 5? 4? 3? 2? 1?</p><p>I went out of my way to see The Irishman on the big screen. It was a film that demanded my undivided attention. And like The Brutalist, it clocks in at 200+ minutes ? just, in this case, without an intermission. The result was absolutely captivating, a cinematic journey through an entire lifetime, its runtime entirely justified. It\'s just, I could barely walk by the time the credits rolled. I literally staggered out of the King\'s Cross Everyman.</p><p>Martin Scorsese has eschewed the use of intermissions - as is his absolute right, being one of the greatest filmmakers of all time - despite his recent films reaching gargantuan lengths; certain cinemas that put their own intermission into Killers Of The Flower Moon (runtime: 198 minutes) came under fire, having broken their licensing agreements to do so. Legendary editor Thelma Schoonmaker said including an intermission was \'not right\'. To my mind, both Irishman and Killers really could have done with one, at a point of the filmmakers\' choosing.</p><p>The argument against intermissions, it seems, is that they break the immersion of the cinema experience. One minute you\'re caught up in the story; the next, the lights are up, people are milling around, checking their phones, and restocking on snacks. But I\'d argue that it increases immersion when the film is actually playing. It can be more distracting to pace your liquid intake, or to squash that wandering thought about the thing you forgot to do before the film started, or to ignore those stomach rumbles when a film doesn\'t offer a break. If you designate a time for audiences to do whatever they need to do, you then mark the film itself as a time to lock in. Knowing an intermission is coming is its own relief.</p><p>Best of all, an intermission can be used as a dramatic tool - it offers a punctuation point in the story, the chance to drop a cliffhanger, or to allow a dramatic moment to breathe. It can, I\'d argue, heighten the audience experience. The positive reception to The Brutalist\'s intermission isn\'t just because it breaks up a lengthy movie - it\'s a fun additional part of the cinema experience, and a moment for those caught up in the story to rave about it at the midway mark. Clearly, given how many people I\'ve seen sharing images from their intermission on social media, it\'s going down incredibly well with regular audiences.</p><p>I don\'t want filmmakers to rein in their three-hour epics. And I don\'t want intermissions dropped at random into films that don\'t need them. But the relationship between movie epics and the audience\'s needs should be considered. Come on, Hollywood - give us a break.</p><p>The Brutalist is out now in UK cinemas. With an interval.</p>', '19_intermission.png', 14, 5, 11, '2025-01-27', '2025-01-27'),
(20, 'Robert Eggers Will Follow Nosferatu With 13th Century-Set Werwulf Movie', 'Eggers To Direct Period Werwulf Movie', '<p>If you\'ve seen Nosferatu on the big screen recently, chances are you\'re still under the thrall of Robert Eggers\' gloriously gothic vision - which took the cinematic vampire classic and gave it a full-blooded retelling, perfectly suited to the man behind The Witch and The Lighthouse. And it seems Eggers is still in monster mode - because his next project sees him moving from vampires to werewolves, in an original film titled Werwulf.</p><p>As reported by THR, the film will be set in the 13th century (in true Eggers style, hewing as close to the reality of the period as possible), with Eggers directing from a screenplay he co-wrote with Icelandic poet Sjón, with whom he also penned The Northman. It\'ll be another film that Eggers makes for Focus Features, with plans to release on Christmas Day in 2026. While it doesn\'t sound like the most festive affair, it\'s a strategy that won out on Nosferatu - which hit US cinemas on Christmas Day just a few weeks ago, and has become a significant box office hit.</p><p>Could this be the beginning of Eggers\' own Dark Universe? Does he have a take on Frankenstein - or, even better, a realistically dank take on Creature From The Black Lagoon - that he could tackle next? Whatever happens, we\'re practically howling at the moon in anticipation.</p>', '20_eggersWulf.png', 14, 5, 11, '2025-01-22', '2025-01-22');
